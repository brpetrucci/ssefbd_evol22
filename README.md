# Testing SSE models with FBD

This repository contains simulation and analysis scripts for a simulation study intending to test the power and error rates of State Speciation and Extinction (SSE) models with the inclusion of fossil data using a Fossilized Birth-Death (FBD) model.

## Proof of concept: EEOB 565

The first stage of this project will be a simpler proof of concept style simulation study to assess the performance of BiSSE estimates of extinction rates using an FBD tree.
